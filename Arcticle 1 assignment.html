    <h1>BREAKING: US Determines Genocide in Sudan, Sanctions RSF Leader Hemedti</h1>
    <hr>
    <p><b>John Prendergast, co-founder of The Sentry</b>, said: “RSF leader General Hemedti is ultimately responsible for some of the most heinous atrocities being committed anywhere in the world today.  Without serious measures of legal and financial accountability, the RSF will continue its rampage.  Today’s actions by the Biden administration – including the genocide determination as well as sanctions against Hemedti and some of the foreign firms profiting from Sudan’s chaos – are an important start to creating that accountability.  These actions hopefully can provide leverage both for deterring future human rights crimes as well as for helping to drag the RSF into treating ceasefire negotiations more seriously.”</p>
    <p><b>Brian Adeba, Senior Advisor at The Sentry</b>, said: “For far too long, mass atrocities that amount to genocide have occurred in the Darfur region of Sudan. In the current conflict, these atrocities have been recorded in several regions of the country. Today’s genocide determination sends a strong message to victims that their suffering is recognized, and justice is being sought. Most importantly, the determination signals that the world is waking up to the task of holding those who commit mass atrocities accountable. This determination must be accompanied by bold and concrete action to not only hold perpetrators accountable, but also protect civilians, and support the pursuit of justice and peace in Sudan.</p>

    <h1>BREAKING: “Deepening descent” into corruption in Libya, “parallels with Syria”</h1>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Charles Cater, Director of Investigations at The Sentry</b>, said: “The Dabaiba family, who now holds power in Tripoli and who previously oversaw Libya’s public works sector during Qadhafi’s rule in the 2000s, bears responsibility for mismanaging crucial infrastructure contracts, including a gross lack of maintenance of the Derna dam. Their misconduct contributed to the tragic catastrophe in Derna, which destroyed a historic city and killed thousands. Now, the ongoing reconstruction of Derna presents similar risks. With Field Marshal Haftar and his family controlling the rebuilding process, there are renewed signs of abuse and fund misappropriation. The secret deal-making and opaque operations of the Haftars should raise red flags for corruption and renewed concerns for infrastructure integrity.”</p>
    
    <p><b>Oliver Windridge, Director of Illicit Finance Policy at The Sentry</b> said: “International policymakers should require maximum transparency from the reconstruction funds managed by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar’s faction in eastern Libya, insisting that they submit to oversight from legitimate Libyan financial institutions like the Audit Bureau. More broadly, law enforcement and financial authorities in the US, UK, Europe, and in other nations with an interest in supporting a more stable, secure region should help investigate the past misappropriation of Libyan infrastructure funds, work to return these resources to the Libyan people, and step up efforts to counter a deepening descent into kleptocracy.”</p>
